# Prim's Algorithm with Min Heap and Adjacency Matrix

## Author
Richard Pak (130109717)

## Description
This program utilizes an adjacency matrix and a minHeap data structure to use Prim's algorithm in finding the minimum spanning
tree (MST) of a graph with multiple vertices and edge weights. Assuming that the vertices of the given graph in main.cpp are 
connected, the program creates an adjacency matrix to hold the edge weights between all the vertices, and uses it to build the 
minHeap, which is a priority queue that keeps track of all the vertices and its edge weights. The minHeap helps retrieve the next vertex 
that connects to our tree with the lowest edge weight.

## How to Compile and Run
This project was developed and tested in CLion.  
Run directly from the IDE.

## Time Complexity Analysis


| Operation            | Time Complexity |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Insert in MinHeap    | O(logn)         |
| Extract Min          | O(logn)         |
| Decrease Key         | O(logn)         |
| Primâ€™s MST Overall   | O(n^2logn)      |

_Explain why your MST implementation has the above runtime._
- Insert in MinHeap (O(logn)): Since there contains a while loop that divides the temp/size variable by half every time the while loop is entered. This make it so that n is the height of the binary heap.
- Extract Min (O(logn)): The function runs at O(1) until it calls the function minHeapify(), which runs at O(logn) due to how it recursively calls itself onto its binary heap. 
- Decrease Key (O(logn)): Similar to the function "Insert in Minheap", this function runs at O(1) until it reaches it's while loop which can iterate as many times as the height of the binary heap.
- Prim's MST Overall (O(n^2logn)): The n^2 part in the time complexity comes from the time complexity of creating the adjacency matrix. Since the adjacency matrix is a 2-dimensional array that has the same length for its rows and columns, the size would be nxn. When finding adjacent vertices in the adjacency matrix, you would need to scan each row for n vertices, which makes the overall time complexity O(n^2).
                                 The logn part of the time complexity comes from how much time it would take to retrieve the minimum key vertex from the minHeap on average.
                                Since the adjacency matrix and the minHeap operations are done in separate classes, you multiply the two separate time complexities and get a final time complexity of O(n^2logn) for Prim's algorithm.

## Test Case Description
Assuming that the given graph is already connected, tested a test case with 10 vertices that have various edges that could be used to create different and valid MST's
Input:  
0 --- 1 (3)
0 --- 2 (4)
0 --- 3 (1)
1 --- 3 (2)
1 --- 4 (5)
2 --- 3 (6)
2 --- 5 (3)
3 --- 4 (5)
3 --- 5 (2)
3 --- 6 (1)
3 --- 7 (3)
4 --- 7 (3)
5 --- 6 (4)
5 --- 8 (2)
6 --- 7 (2)
6 --- 8 (1)
6 --- 9 (5)
7 --- 9 (4)
8 --- 9 (7)

Final MST Edges:
3 --- 1 (2)
5 --- 2 (3)
0 --- 3 (1)
7 --- 4 (3)
3 --- 5 (2)
3 --- 6 (1)
6 --- 7 (2)
6 --- 8 (1)
7 --- 9 (4)
Total MST weight = 19

## Overcome Challenge
My final MST was giving me an incorrect total weight, so I made a function to output my adjacency matrix.
Realized I forgot to set the weight for BOTH variations of how the vertices can be chosen. Therefore, I
implemented the fix in the function "addEdge" by making sure to set the weight for both adjMatrix[u][v] and 
adjMatrix[v][u].
